This is my second project from my course at General Assembly

-------------------------
Design Decisions & Issues
-------------------------

The original idea of my app was a dedication as it were to the Suffragettes. I wanted to have the design of the app to be simple, classy and none fussy. Because the history of the Suffragettes was so profound, I wanted my app to not be swollowed up by fussy colours and added extras. Originally I wanted my colours to be the straight suffragette colours of purple, green and white however, in the end product I decided to calm this down to just hold tiny aspects of these colours around the app without it being so bold.

-----------------------Decisions ----------------
I dedicated 2 days of my project at the very beginning to collate an excel sheet worth of historical facts with also pin point lat and lang locations to pop on my map. I stretched these pin points not only to London but to Manchester and Epsom also. I always wanted a historical map for this project as apose to a live map with live updated data. My original idea was a map of murders however, the subject of the Suffragettes appealed to me more and I knew that I would be passionate about this subject for the full week.

-----------------------Issues --------------------------------

One of the main issues during this project was getting the styling right. Although the coding itself was still very tricky, through previous examples and personal notes I understood the concepts and I totally understood with some time how to implement them into my project. I felt so much more confident with the structure of my code than my first project and I took on board errors that I came across as apose to just freaking out.

Sorting out how to pop in the different locations through a drop down was also a stuggle on this project. I had to have some form of drop down with the 4 locations of my information and this took me half a day to work out.

Steps & Building

---------------------------Steps ----------------------------

1. Collate the information for my seed file (using internet, books, articles etc)
2. Sorting out my schema
3. Sorting out the authenticiation of my app. Login, Password, Register
4. Sorting out my forms and getting the actual googlemaps onto my app itself.

----------------------------Build ---------------------------

Packages: 
```gulp
babel
mongoose
cors
body-parser
bcrypt
jsonwebtoken
```

Styling was using ```SASS and Bootstrap```

My Suffragette Map
This project was an historical api Express app. A user can register, login and click on different historical Suffragette locations. Once on the location you will see a pop up pin with a picture and historical fact about that specific pin. 

The main packages I used were Babel, Cors, Body-Parser, Bcrypt and Gulp.
