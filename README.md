My Suffragette Map
This project was an historical api Express app. A user can register, login and click on different historical Suffragette locations. Once on the location you will see a pop up pin with a picture and historical fact about that specific pin. 

The main packages I used were Babel, Cors, Body-Parser, Bcrypt and Gulp.
